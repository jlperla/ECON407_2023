## Course Overview

This is a course in computational tools used in macroeconomics.  You are expected to have some proficiency in Matlab, Python, Julia, and similar languages as fulfilled in the prerequisites (i.e., ECON 323, CPSC 103, CPSC 110, MATH 210, COMM 337).  Even intermediate knowledge of R is typically not sufficient.

Models in macroeconomics and financial economics are constructed from a core set of tools which model each agents' decisions while maintaining an internal consistency between the decisions of complicated distributions of other agents in an economy.

<!-- "Models" in economics formally describe how the behavior of different "agents" (e.g, households, workers, firms) interact to provide an artificial laboratory.  Since many of the features and assumptions used in macroeconomic models interact and must all simultaneously hold, researchers and practitioners usually require computers to solve and interpret these types of economic models. -->
Some of the common features of models in macroeconomics and financial economics include:

1. __dynamic and forward looking decisions__: If I consume less today, I can save more for tomorrow;
2. __randomness and uncertainty about the future__: If reject a job offer, I am not sure when the next offer will occur;
3. __prices and resources reflecting the collective decisions of other agents__: The wage I am offered depends on the number of similar workers I am competing with, the intensity which the unemployed search for jobs, and the demand for my skills from firms;
4. __social learning from other agents' with information aggregated through prices__: If many others consider a particular equity or bond asset a good buy, then I can infer this by the price of the asset itself; and
5. __distributions and heterogeneity in the economy influencing decisions and prices__: If the distribution of income is askew and there are many poor agents living hand-to-mouth, government policy such as sending out stimulus cheques has a different effect on inflation and consumer welfare than if every person had similar incomes.

The interaction between these makes it difficult to do counter-factual experiments with "partial-equilibrium" in macroeconomics---i.e., changing one price or element of the model in isolation---because of the interconnection of decisions, prices, and distributions.   However, by writing formal models in mathematics, we can conduct policy experiments and interpret data while still ensuring all of these conditions for self-consistency.  Using precise mathematical language will (1) uncover unanticipated consequences implicit in your assumptions; (2) keep everyone honest; (3) provide a framework to investigate changes in assumptions; and (4) allow disciplined nesting of models to add enough "reality" for quantitative analysis.

The downside is that while this set of mathematical tools provides a rich set of economic theories that can be explored and tested against the data, the inherent difficulty of dynamic models means that we may usually need to solve them approximately and on a computer.

This course is designed to jointly explore these sorts of theoretical models in conjunction with the computational tools to solve and simulate them.  We will learn using the Julia programming language—--a modern language for scientific and technical computing. If you have an existing background in Python or Matlab from other courses you will find that Julia compliments those skills.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to

1. program using tools from linear algebra, probability, and optimization in the Julia programming language
2. simulate and analyze stochastic processes for the purpose of understanding the evolution of the wealth distribution
3. describe economic dynamics as a linear state space model and solve them numerically
4. implement and analyze Markov chains, and apply them to models of unemployment and asset pricing
5. investigate the role of general equilibrium and prices in aggregating information and reflecting the real economy
6. define economic problems recursively, such labor market search and consumption savings models, and solve them numerically
7. define and implement dynamic models of growth

## Textbook and Materials

The core textbook is the online, open-source textbook [Quantitative Economics with Julia](https://julia.quantecon.org/) by Jesse Perla, Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski which contains both graduate- and undergraduate-level material.  In cases where material in the course is too advanced, we will choose a subset and adapt lecture materials to be appropriate for the level.

The textbook includes both theory and code, and a set of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-julia.notebooks).

## Course Format

The course will meet for two 1.5 hours lectures per week for an in-class lecture. While there will not be a formal "lab", the instructor may go through coding examples in class.

After the first few weeks the lectures will tend to focus on teaching the theory where code implementations done largely in the assignments.  At that point, much of the coding practice will be done in the problem sets, leaving most class-time for connecting the macroeconomic models to the methods.

## Assignments and Assessment

The only way to learn how to apply programming to economic problems is practice. To aid this, a significant portion of the assessment will be in the form of problem sets.

The midterm and final will be in class and combine both theory and computations, with the exam submitted via a Jupyter notebook.

The weighting in the grade is:

- 6-8 problem sets: 20% (total)
- Midterm exam: 30%
- Final exam: 50%

The midterm examinations will be done in a computer lab and contain a mixture of theory and computational questions.  The final exam will be a mixture of theory and computational questions, and will be submitted via a Jupyter notebook.

The problem sets will start off short and easy to help those with less programming experience, and then build in complexity.

## Computational Infrastructure and Programming Language

While you will have experience with another programming language such as Python or Matlab from your prerequisites, this course will be taught using [Julia](https://julialang.org/).  Beyond being an excellent language for technical computing and popular among macroeconomists, Julia provides a new set of programming principles that will broaden the your knowledge of computing.  This will help you by both providing a better differentiated resume, broader skills, and more opportunities to work as a research assistant for researchers requiring significant computational expertise.

You can install Julia on your laptop by following [these instructions](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html).  While one can use Julia entirely from just Jupyter notebook, we will also introduce basic [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) usage as well to help broaden your exposure to computational tools.

## Policies

**Missed Exam Policy:** You are responsible for ensuring that you take these exams as scheduled; no make-up exams will be given.

- Missing a midterm for ANY acceptable reason will result in its weight being automatically transferred to the final exam.
- The final exam date will be announced by Student Services about half-way through the term.
- There is no make-up final. Travel plans and/or cheap tickets are not a reason to miss the final. If you have a medical	or other compelling reason why you cannot take the final exam at its scheduled time you must follow the formal process and get a Standing Deferred Academic Concession from your Faculty Advising Office (see below)

**Policy for Academic Concessions:**
Sometimes, things happen during the course of a semester that can affect your ability to succeed.  There are three main categories:

- Medical – i.e. you got sick and missed class or a chronic illness got worse
- Compassionate – i.e. a friend or close relative had something bad happen to them, or something bad happened to you.
- Conflicting Responsibilities – i.e. something happened in your personal life which is affecting your ability to do the work, like childcare falling through

You can read more about specific examples and the whole policy at:
http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0

In all of these cases, UBC’s policy is to allow you to request an academic concession.  My policy is that all requests for academic concession on exams should be handled through your faculty Advising office (unless your office advises otherwise).  This is so that we can centrally track requests for concession and ensure they are fairly administered; it also helps protect your privacy.  You can find the procedure here, for Arts:

https://students.arts.ubc.ca/advising/academic-performance/help-academic-concession/

If you need a concession, you should immediately speak to Advising, who will follow-up with me to handle the academic side of things.  In-term concessions, which handle things like missed assignments or deadlines, are handled usually by extending the deadline or adjusting the final grading of the course (e.g. omitting an assessment).  Alternative forms of assessment may also be used if suitable and recommended by Advising.

Concessions need to be made in a timely fashion, which I will define as “within 2 weeks of the missed assessment” unless this is not reasonable.
You are also welcome to speak to me regarding your issue; I’m here to support you and help you get through things and be successful.  If you’re not sure if it’s something you should/could get a concession for, I can also give you a quick sense of what Advising will likely suggest if you’re unable to make an appointment immediately. 


**Academic Integrity**
It is the policy of the VSE to report all violations of UBC’s standards for academic
honesty to the office of the Dean of Arts. A detailed description of academic integrity,
including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the UBC Calendar:
Student Conduct and Discipline. In addition to the violations stated on that page (for
example, plagiarism), the VSE rules state that any student who hires a tutor/editor to help
with any portion of their work will be given an automatic grade of zero on their submitted
work. Any student found to have violated the university rules on academic misconduct
will receive a grade of zero on the relevant work. Further penalties, may be levied by the
President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Those further penalties could
include a notation on your transcript indicating that you have committed an academic
offence, failure of the course, and/or suspension from the university.

**Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities**
The University of British Columbia recognizes its moral and legal duty to provide
academic accommodation. The University must remove barriers and provide
opportunities to students with a disability, enabling them to access university services,
programs, and facilities and to be welcomed as participating members of the University
community. The University’s goal is to ensure fair and consistent treatment of all
students, including students with a disability, in accordance with their distinct needs and
in a manner consistent with academic principles. The University will provide academic
accommodation to students with disabilities in accordance with the British Columbia
Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210 and the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982
(U.K.), 1982, c. 11. Provision of academic accommodation shall not lower the academic
standards of the University. Academic accommodation shall not remove the need for
evaluation and the need to meet essential learning outcomes. Students with a disability
who wish to have an academic accommodation should contact Centre for Accessibility
without delay (see UBC Policy 73).

**Conflicting Responsibilities**
UBC recognizes that students may occasionally have conflicting responsibilities that
affect their ability to attend class or examinations. These may include: representing the
University, the province or the country in a competition or performance; serving in the
Canadian military; or observing a religious rite. They may also include a change in a
student’s situation that unexpectedly requires that student to work or take responsibility
for the care of a family member, if these were not pre-existing situations at the start of
term.

Students with conflicting responsibilities have a duty to arrange their course schedules to
avoid, as much as possible, any conflicts with course requirements. As soon as
conflicting responsibilities arise, students must notify either their instructor(s) or their
Faculty Advising Office (e.g. Arts Academic Advising), and can request academic
concession. Instructors may not be able to comply with all such requests if the academic
standards and integrity of the course or program would be compromised.

Varsity student-athletes should discuss any anticipated and unavoidable regular-season
absences with the instructor at the start of term and provide notice of playoff or
championship absences in writing as soon as dates are confirmed.
Religious observance may preclude attending classes or examinations at certain times. In
accordance with the UBC Policy on Religious Holidays, students who wish to be
accommodated for religious reasons must notify their instructors in writing at least two
weeks in advance. Instructors provide opportunity for such students to make up work or
examinations missed without penalty.


**Policies and Resources to Support Student Success**
UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but
recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access
including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and
ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not
tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate
accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances.
UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas
generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all their actions.
Details of the policies and how to access support are available here
